# Towards a Measurement Framework of Cultural Capital in Social Mediated Movements: A Computational Approach
This project was a part of CKIDS DataFest 2020 organized Graduate Rising in Informatics and Data Science at University of Southern California.
We submitted a paper to the National Communications Association, Annual Conference October 2020.

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to obtain a novel metric to measure cultural capital of influencers in social media movements. Cultural capital can be used for spanning class boundaries and increasing marginal groups' social impact and cultural appeals. For social movements that are organized by grassroot actors, a broadened cultural appeal could magnify their impact and contribution to their mobilization efforts. In current scenarios where movements take place online, it is important to study the cultural capital of online social media movements. However, existing literature either uses traditional methods such as surveys or applied qualitative methods such as netnography. In this paper, we present a computational framework for measuring activist's cultural capital.
